This application serves as a social media site for gamers! Users can log in securely with their name, email, and password to create an account. Once logged in, a user is prompted to save their personal preferences to their profile. Users can post and comment within varios channels representing popular gaming platforms, as well as view other people's profiles. When viewing another user's profile, the logged in user can add them as a friend. A user's personal profile has sections that display their playstyle, favorite console(s), friend's list, and the various posts they've made throughout the channels.
